# WemosD1R2-Temperature-Measuring

Microcontroller WEMOSD1R2 with ESP8266 WiFi module that measures the surrounding area with BME280 temperature and pressure sensor. Can also calculate the approx altitude

Measurements are sent to a node js server, displayed on a react website and saved in Firebase database.

No longer making new measurements as I have disassembled the microcontroller for other projects
